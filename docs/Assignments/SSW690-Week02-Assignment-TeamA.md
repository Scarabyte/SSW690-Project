# **Assignment**

Each team must:

1. Gather requirements/user stories using whatever techniques you prefer
2. Document the major features your project will deliver in GitHub and assign an initial priority to each feature
3. Identify the features in your project&#39;s Minimal Viable Product
4. Create a GitHub milestone to define the issues to be addressed in the first sprint
5. Create the first draft of your Development Plan using the Dev Plan Template ([https://sit.instructure.com/courses/28338/modules/items/611547](https://sit.instructure.com/courses/28338/modules/items/611547)) in the course materials section of Canvas.

We will do a quick informal review of the features in the MVP and your plans for the first sprint in class on Week 3.
