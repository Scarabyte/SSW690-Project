## **Assignment**

1. Form teams of 4-6 members.   Each team will be responsible for delivering a software project along with a final presentation.   You&#39;ll want your team ideally to have a variety of skills, including project management, requirements, user experience, development, testing, documentation, and presentation skills.    You&#39;ll also need to choose a team leader who can speak for the team and can also help the team to reach decisions on the many tough questions that are certain to arise during the project sprints.
2. Choose a project area that your team will deliver by the end of term.   We will discuss several alternatives in the first class but you may also choose your own topic.
3. Create a project space on github.com for your team&#39;s project.
4. Create a brief 10-15 minute presentation that describes your project including the topic, the customers, and a few of the impacts your software project will have on its customers, i.e. how does your project make the world a better place?   Each team will present their project proposal to the class at the second lecture.
5. Identify how and when your team will interact and work together, e.g. will you meet in person on Monday evening at 8:00 PM or will you meet online with Slack, Google Hangouts, etc.?
6. Add your presentation materials to your team&#39;s GitHub project repository.
