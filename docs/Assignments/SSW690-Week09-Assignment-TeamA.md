Weeks 4-12 are dedicated to building, testing, documenting, and deploying your project.  You should use GitHub for source control and project tracking.

Each team will meet weekly with faculty to discuss current status, issues, and concerns.  We'll also review the issues in your GitHub repository so be sure to keep GitHub up to date.

### Sprint 3 Week 2

At the conclusion of Sprint 3, we implemented the Sky View transformation and started working on the next step in the lane detection algorithm, fitting curves to the detected lines.

We also improved the testing framework, which will allow us to lead selected stock images for testing purposes (so no need to physically take the app out to a road!), and we started discussing the final presentation (based on feedback from the professor, we're looking at how to market our app to a non-technical customer as well as a technically-minded one).
