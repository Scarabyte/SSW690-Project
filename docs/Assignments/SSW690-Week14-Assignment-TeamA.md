# **Assignment**

Hopefully your project is up and running flawlessly and your team formed a new start up company to collect the rewards of all of your hard work and success!

Your final assignment is for each team to prepare a 20-30 minute presentation that describes your project.  You should include:

- The problem your team started out to solve
- Major features (or how your product improves the lives of its users)
- The high level architecture and design
- The tools and platforms used by your solution
- The challenges your team encountered along the way and how you solved those problems
- The role and individual contributions of each team member (each team member should present their contributions)
- Lessons learned: What worked well and not so well?   If you were to restart, what changes would you make to your choice of tools, processes, etc?
- A live demonstration of your project working (hopefully flawlessly)
