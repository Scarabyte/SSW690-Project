### Sprint 2 Week 2

For the second half of Sprint 2, we concentrated on completing the user stories and research we had assigned ourselves. At the conclusion of the sprint, we now have a functional camera calibration method, and understand the steps that will be needed to continue with the lane identification function. In addition, we have also been working on modifying the app to accept stock images, which will allow us to feed in arbitrary images that we can use for testing purposes. As a result of our work and research, and with a little better understanding of the work involved, some elements of the "Identify Road Features" epic have been closed, and the story point estimates on others have been reduced slightly.
