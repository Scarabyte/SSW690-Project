### Sprint 2 Week 2

For the second half of Sprint 2, we concentrated on completing the user stories and research we had assigned ourselves. At the conclusion of the sprint, we now have a functional camera calibration method, and understand the steps that will be needed to continue with the lane identification function. In addition, we have also been working on modifying the app to accept stock images, which will allow us to feed in arbitrary images that we can use for testing purposes. As a result of our work and research, and with a little better understanding of the work involved, some elements of the "Identify Road Features" epic have been closed, and the story point estimates on others have been reduced slightly.

As mentioned in the Week 6 update, our general testing strategy involves feeding stock images and videos into our app and verifying that the lanes are correctly identified, and confirming on our physical devices that the app performs adequately at the user level. At least initially this will be primarily a manual effort, however we are also creating the framework that will eventually allow some or all of the testing to be automated. (As also mentioned in the Week 6 update, we don't necessarily expect to complete exhaustive testing at this stage, but we do plan to have at least exercised enough of the functionality that we would be comfortable giving it to a third party with the proviso that it's a prototype model.)
