Weeks 4-12 are dedicated to building, testing, documenting, and deploying your project.  You should use GitHub for source control and project tracking.

Each team will meet weekly with faculty to discuss current status, issues, and concerns.  We'll also review the issues in your GitHub repository so be sure to keep GitHub up to date.

We have also started working on the final presentation; some slides are already in place, and we are looking at options for showing a demo video.
