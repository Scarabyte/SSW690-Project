# **Assignment**

Weeks 4-12 are dedicated to building, testing, documenting, and deploying your project.  You should use GitHub for source control and project tracking.

Each team will meet weekly with faculty to discuss current status, issues, and concerns.  We&#39;ll also review the issues in your GitHub repository so be sure to keep GitHub up to date.

### Sprint 1 Week 2

The team has completed the initial set of user stories targeted for Sprint 1, and has also been researching lane identification and detection techniques in anticipation of upcoming sprints. As a result of what we learned in Sprint 1, we may elect to make some design changes in the application to improve performance and testability, and also in support of our research. These will be discussed during the Sprint 2 planning meeting.

We have been using feature branches in our development; this allows each team member to work on their assigned tasks independently, and the changes can be merged into the master branch once they're ready. Using the "pull request" tool also allows us to optionally have another team member review the proposed changes prior to merging.

The "ZenHub" plugin allows us to input story point estimates, as well as mark dependencies if one task has to be completed before another. It also has some improved pipelines for the Kanban board compared to the stock GitHub Issues application, and so far has been working quite well for tracking progress.

Overall status: There are still some challenges ahead in terms of identifying the lane markings, but we are doing well with the progress made to date.
