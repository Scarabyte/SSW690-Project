* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Completed Sprint 1 task to perform Canny Edge detection. Note that the parameters may need to change depending on how well our detection algorithm functions.
  * Researched lane detection methods. Came up with the following sequence:
    1. Correct image distortion with calibration data (requires calibration function to have completed).
    2. Apply a region of interest and transform to 'sky view'.
    3. Filter the image to find the lane markers.
    4. Fit curves to both left and right side lane markers.
    5. Project back onto the original image for display.
