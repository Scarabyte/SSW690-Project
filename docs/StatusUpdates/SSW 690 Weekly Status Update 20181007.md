### Team Status Summary: Where are we now?

_One or two sentences describing high level project status and progress._
After Sprint 1, we have a sample app that can locate and highlight straight lines in an arbitrary image. The main goal of Sprint 2 is to start refining that to identify actual lane markers; as such, we have a series of tasks identified on the Kanban board that are working towards this result.

Goals for Week 6 of class:
* Plan Sprint 2: determine which issues in the backlog to tackle and make assignments
* Start working on Sprint 2 tasks

### Last week&#39;s activities by team member:

#### Adam:

* _What did I work on?_
  * Estimates and planning for Sprint 2
  * General team administration tasks including meeting with the professor (customer) and updating documents
  * Researching image manipulation/transformation methods
* _What did I accomplish?_

#### Sapana:

* _What did I work on?_
* _What did I accomplish?_

#### Keith:

* _What did I work on?_
  * Sprint activity - Camera Calibration
* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Camera calibration

#### Rakshith:

* _What did I work on?_
* _What did I accomplish?_

### Issues, Risks, and Opportunities:

* _What problems did you encounter and what impact might those have on meeting the project schedule?_
  * One team member will be on business travel and may have reduced availability; as always, there may also be other personal or work-related issues that require attention. With a small team, the effect is definitely felt whenever one member has to drop out.
* _What new opportunities did you discover, if any?_
  * We have discovered multiple methods for solving many of our problems (for example, there are two or three different possibilities for identifying the region of interest in a picture and for converting it to "sky view"); our general approach is to start with the simplest method, and then upgrade to a more complex method later on if and when it's needed.

### Action Items/Goals for next week:

#### Team Goals for next week:

* _Where do we want the project to be next week?_
  * At least the first half of the "Identify Road features" epic should be completed, which is the task we set ourselves for Sprint 2; if we happen to finish ahead of schedule we can get a head start on the subsequent tasks.
  * We should also have continued development of the test framework so that we can make use of our stock images and video.

#### Individual Goals

##### Adam:

* _What do you plan to work on and accomplish in the next week?_
  * After researching image manipulations, I have a general conceptual understanding of the steps needed for our application; the next challenge will be to convert that into usable code.

##### Sapana:

* _What do you plan to work on and accomplish in the next week?_

##### Keith:

* _What do you plan to work on and accomplish in the next week?_
  * Sprint activity: Correct image distortion.
  * Research: Adding sliders to dynamically adjust image processing parameters in real-time.

##### Rakshith:

* _What do you plan to work on and accomplish in the next week?_

### Other Comments:

* _Any other relevant information to help us to manage the project and keep our customer informed and happy._
  * The professor (customer) seemed very pleased with the state of our project at the end of Sprint 1, and with our continued plan for Sprint 2 and beyond. We will continue to discuss our progress at the weekly class meetings, and demonstrate the evolution of our app when new iterations are available.
