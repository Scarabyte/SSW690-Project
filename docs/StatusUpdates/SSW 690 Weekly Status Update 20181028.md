### Team Status Summary: Where are we now?

_One or two sentences describing high level project status and progress._

Goals for Week 9 of class:
Continue working on lane detection algorithm and testing framework from where we left them after Sprint 2.

### Last week's activities by team member:

#### Adam:

* _What did I work on?_
  * Completed sky view task
  * Reviewed code and continued lane detection research
* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Got some screenshots to demo the sky view mode

#### Sapana:

* _What did I work on?_
  * With Keith's help finished task 57 for testing
* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Test of LDWSProcessor (lane detection) with stock image. Need some more work in next Sprint.
  * Understood how the Android ImageView class works
  
#### Keith:

* _What did I work on?_
  * Testing task
  * Fit Curves task
* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Architected the ability to perform a self test on a stock image. This involved creating another Activity with an ImageView widget, bound to a menu item available in the toolbar. The stock image is loaded from a resource file with the application, sent to the LDWS Processor to run our algorithms and processing, then the processed image is displayed on screen.
  * Began, but did not finish, the Fit Curves task. Implemented a Sobel filter to isolate the lane markings. Begin the development of a sliding window lane detection algorithm that finds the peaks of the intensities of the images and establishes a series of points that identify the middle of the lane markings. This will then be used as input to a curve fitting algorithm.

#### Rakshith:

* _What did I work on?_
  * Adam incorporated the area of interest into this commits while working on sky view.
  * Researched articles related to figuring out lane edge
* _What did I accomplish?_
  * Did not accomplish completion of sprint 3 goal. Adam stepped in to finish up the story assigned to me

### Issues, Risks, and Opportunities:

* _What problems did you encounter and what impact might those have on meeting the project schedule?_
