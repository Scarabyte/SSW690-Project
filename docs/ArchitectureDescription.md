# Architecture Description

## 1. Scope
This Architecture Description provides a high level overview and some details on the architecture of the Back Seat Driver application for the Android platform. The Back Seat Driver application will utilize the smart phone's camera to process a video of the oncoming road/surface in order to detect the travel lane and warn the operator when the vehicle is departing the lane (i.e., Lane Departure Warning System, or LDWS). This document describes the internal organization of the application from multiple perspectives to aid in the understanding, development, testing and maintenance of the application.
