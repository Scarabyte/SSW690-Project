### Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) Functionality

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_departure_warning_system): A lane detection system uses the principle of [Hough transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) and [Canny edge detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) to detect lane lines from realtime camera images fed from the front-end camera of the automobile.
